## Question Statement
* `Dev a code for a form that can post response into an email address.`

* `Design a tip system that would display different tips/quote depending on different visits`

<br>

# How to run it
Clone this respository and do the following.

I assume you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) Installed (and [create a virtual environment](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/), virutal environment is optional anyway)

* run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* run `python manage.py runserver`
* fill the form, and check the console for the mail.


It shows different tips/quotes for every visits.
